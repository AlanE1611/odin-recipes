    <h3>Ceviche de pescado.</h3>
    <p>This typical dish of the Ecuador is made with fresh fish "cooked" in lime juice with hot peppers and garlic, and then mixed with lime marinated red onions, tomatoes, bell peppers, and cilantro.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds of fresh white fish fillets.</li>
        <li>2-3 hot peppers.</li>
        <li>2-4 garlic cloves.</li>
        <li>2-3 small red onions.</li>
        <li>4 tomatoes.</li>
        <li>2 bell peppers.</li>
        <li>20 small to medium sized limes.</li>
        <li>1 bunch of cilantro.</li>
        <li>2-3 tablespoon of oil.</li>
        <li>Sat to taste.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps.</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the diced raw fish in a large bowl or dish with the sliced hot peppers, garlic cloves, a tablespoon of chopped cilantro, 1-2 teaspoons of salt, and cover it with lime juice from about 10 limes, the fish should be completely covered or almost completely covered by the lime juice.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate it for about 3-4 hours.</li>
        <li>Place the sliced onions or shallots in a bowl, sprinkle them with a few teaspoons of salt and add warm water (enough to cover the onions), let rest for about 10 minutes, drain and rinse well with cold water.</li>
        <li>Combine the rinsed onions with the diced tomatoes and diced bell peppers. Add the juice from about 5 limes and some salt. Let this mix marinate for at least 10 minutes, it can also be prepared ahead of time and refrigerated until ready to mix with the fish.</li>
        <li>Once the fish is “cooked” in the lime juice, it should be completely white, remove the sliced hot peppers and garlic cloves. Based on your preference, and the acidity level, you can keep all the lime juice where the fish cooked in, or just some of it. You can strain the liquid to remove any pieces of hot peppers (or seeds) or garlic.</li>
        <li>Add the marinated onion or shallot, tomato, and bell pepper mix to the fish. Add the chopped cilantro, oil, salt and additional lime juice to taste. You can serve immediately or let it rest for another 20-30 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Serve with chifles, patacones, popcorn or corn nuts as well as with some good hot sauce or aji.</li>
    </ol>
